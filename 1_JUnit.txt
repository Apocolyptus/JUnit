#JUnit#

JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven
development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.

JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time; the framework resides under package junit.framework for JUnit 3.8 and earlier, and
under package org.junit for JUnit 4 and later.

A research survey performed in 2013 across 10,000 GitHub projects found that JUnit, along with slf4j-api, are the most popular libraries. Each library was used by 30.7% of projects.
